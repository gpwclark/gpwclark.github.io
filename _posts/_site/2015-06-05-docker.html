<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I recently took a vacation a few days after I had loaded all of my things 
into storage… because I’m moving. Sadly, it seems I packed the charger for
my laptop so this vacation was to be Fedora-less. Luckily I have a 6 year old
Mac laptop (with a chager_ that could get the job done. After messing around
with homebrew for a while, I decided it would be much smarter for me to just
start using docker. The vision is simple, I’m working on my personal website
<a href="http://github.com/gpwclark/gpwclark/github.io">gpwclark.github.io</a> and I want
a Dockerfile to live in this repo that will make my life as a developer really
really easy. When developing a jekyll site you typically run the command:
<code>
jekyll serve --watch
</code>
This command puts your Jekyll site on localhost:4000. If you change any of the
files it will automtically rebuild the site. I want any computer with docker
to be able to do this automatically. That means on any computer I could clone 
my repository, build the Docker image, and then type:
<code>
docker run myblog
</code>
and my site would be up on localhost:4000.</p>
